6.	Suggest an extension to the Euclidean Algorithm that increases the functionality
of your program. Design the pseudocode of
this extension to the Euclidean Algorithm.

Function extended_euclidean_algorithm(a, b):
    """
    Applying the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to determine the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers
    and find coefficients x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a, b).

    Args:
        a (int): First integer.
        b (int): Second integer.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the GCD of the two input integers and coefficients x and y.
